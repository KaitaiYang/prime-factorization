# Prime Factorization
Every positive integer greater than 1 can be expressed as product of prime numbers. This factorization is unique and is called the prime factorization. For example, the number 60 can be decomposed into the factors 2x2x3x5, each of which is prime. Note that the same prime can appear more than once in the factorization. Write a C++ program to display the prime factorization of a given integer n, where 2<=n<=32767.

## Sample I/O
```
Please input an integer: 60
60=2*2*3*5.
```

## Bonus
Write a function **int MinFact(int n)** that returns the minimum prime factor of n. Use this function in your program.
